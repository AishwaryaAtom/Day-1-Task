Objects in JavaScript:
Definition:
An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string or symbol, 
and the corresponding value can be any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitive values like strings, numbers, or booleans.

Creating Objects:
You can create objects using the object literal syntax:
const myObject = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 42,
  key3: true,
  
};
Keys and values are separated by colons, and pairs are separated by commas.
Accessing Values:
You can access values in an object using the key:
console.log(myObject.key1); // Outputs: 'value1'
Here the value is stored inside the keys like 'key1' contains value1,key2 contains 42 and key3 contains true.

Alternatively, you can use square bracket notation:
console.log(myObject['key2']); // Outputs: 42
